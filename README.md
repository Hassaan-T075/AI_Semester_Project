# Clustering Customer Data for Behavior Analysis

# Introduction
This project focuses on clustering customer data to identify distinct groups with similar behaviors. By employing K-means clustering and Agglomerative clustering algorithms, this solution aims to provide valuable insights into customer segmentation and behavior analysis. The project includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment using Python and Streamlit.

# Features
- Data Collection: Obtain a dataset of customer data containing information such as customer ID, age, income, location, and spending habits.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing or inconsistent data, convert categorical variables to numerical, and normalize numerical variables for uniformity.
- Model Building: Utilize K-means and Agglomerative clustering algorithms to train the model on the preprocessed customer data.
- Model Evaluation: Visualize clusters and customer data to assess performance. Evaluate cluster validity using metrics like the Silhouette Score and Rand Index.
- Deployment: Save the final trained models and develop an interactive web application using Streamlit. The application accepts customer data as input and outputs cluster assignments for each customer.
